# Revit Dependency Injection

This repository borrows heavily from [Onbox framework](https://github.com/engthiago/Onboxframework) to create dependency inject with Revit Plugins. Instead of using custom container created by Onbox Team this is using Unity Container.

Additionally i've removed some libraries and utilities (like their mvc like packages). Packed all of it into a single dll.
